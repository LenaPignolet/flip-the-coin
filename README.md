## Overview

### What I learned

For this project, I implemented a semantic HTML structure, with CSS and JavaScript separated into dedicated external files.

To handle the transition between "Heads" and "Tails", I created specific CSS classes and toggled them using JavaScript.

In terms of SEO and accessibility, I added relevant alt attributes to all images, used `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images, and defined explicit width and height values to reduce layout shifts and help the browser render the page more efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) â€“ for best practices around accessibility, `loading="lazy"`, and semantic HTML.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript


## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

Users can:
- Flip a virtual coin and get an instant result (Heads or Tails)
- Interact either by clicking the coin image or the "Random" button
